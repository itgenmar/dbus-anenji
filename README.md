dbus-anenji

DBus interface for Anenji inverters on Venus OS, acting as a MultiPlus emulator (multiplus.py).
This implementation currently exposes inverter status, AC input, and AC output, with no control functions.
PV added - wrong daily calculation reported in VRM. 


📦 Installation
1. Copy Files

Upload the project folder to:

/data/etc/


(/data persists across reboots on Venus OS.)

2. Install Required Packages
opkg update
opkg install python3-pip
pip3 install minimalmodbus

3. Configure the Serial Port

Identify your USB–RS485 device:

ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*


Then edit the main emulator script:

nano multiplus.py


Default device is:

/dev/ttyUSB1


Change this line to match your environment.

⚠️ DBus Serial Battery Conflict

If you are also running dbus-serialbattery, you must prevent it from using the same USB port.

In the serialbattery configuration, set:

EXCLUDED_DEVICES = /dev/ttyUSB1

(Adjust the device tty if yours is different.)

Once all is completed run ./install.sh

🔧 Known Issues
Incorrect DC Values at Startup

Some Anenji inverters report incorrect DC readings if they start while the internal fans are running.

Workaround used:

Install a switch to disable fans at startup

Allow the inverter to boot first

Re-enable fans after battery / PV / AC are connected

This ensures accurate DC voltage reporting.

🌞 PV Input (Not Implemented Yet)

The current version does not expose PV input data.
If anyone has Modbus register details for the Anenji PV side, contributions are welcome.

🧰 Hardware Setup

The inverter communicates via RS485 → USB.

Example adapter setup (see images in repository):

TX/RX A/B connected to inverter’s RS485 port

USB connected to the Venus OS device (e.g., Raspberry Pi / GX device)

✔️ Features Implemented

🤝 Contributions

Pull requests and register maps are welcome!
The goal is to eventually support:

PV input - Work in progress

Charge/Discharge control

Full MultiPlus emulation

Improved Modbus error handling
